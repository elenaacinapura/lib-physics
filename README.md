# lib-physics
Routine functions for data analysis in physics. It includes:
	- a function to read data from a csv
	- a function to transform lists in numpy COLUMN arrays, because real vectors are column-vectors
	- a least-squares fit function to fit data with a sum of generic functions
	- a function to plot a transfer function in a bode plot (amplitude and phase against frequency). It can plot simple points, continous lines and errorbars. It allows for multiple plots in the same figure and customization

INSTALLATION
Instructions to install the library:
