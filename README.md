# Lib-physics
## Routine functions for data analysis in physics. 

This repo includes:
	* a function to read data from a csv and organise it in numpy arrays
	* a function to transform lists in numpy arrays
	* a least-squares fit function to fit data with a sum of generic functions
	* a function to plot a transfer function in a bode plot (amplitude and phase against frequency). It can plot simple points, continous lines and errorbars. It allows for multiple plots in the same figure and customization
